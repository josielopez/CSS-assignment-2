## 5 points:

* Your correct and complete GitHub URL is submitted in Canvas by the deadline.

* Your repo contains the forked contents of the original repo PLUS a new branch named *gh-pages*.

* In the *gh-pages* branch, the file *main.css* has been changed as instructed in Part 1 here: [README.md](README.md).

* When viewed in a web browser on a laptop, the layout of your *index.html* resembles the layout in the example video, as explained in the [README.md](README.md).

* The file *index.html* in your *gh-pages* branch has NOT been changed in ANY way from the forked and cloned version of that file.

* None of the following CSS layout properties were used: `float`, `position`, `display: grid`.

(All criteria above must be met to get 5 points.)

## 10 points:

All of the above. Plus:

* The new files *version2.html* and *version2.css* are in your repo, in the correct locations, according to the instructions under Part 2 in the [README.md](README.md).

* Your *version2.html* is identical to your *index.html*, except for the LINK element.

* All instructions under Part 2 in the [README.md](README.md) have been followed to alter *version2.css*.

* BOTH of your CSS files validate [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

* CSS flex styles are used correctly in both of your CSS files.

* When viewed in a web browser on a laptop, the layout of your *version2.html* resembles the layout in the example video, as explained in the [README.md](README.md). Specifically, all photos and their captions are on the left side, and all text sections are on the right side.

(All criteria must be met to get 10 points.)

## 15 points:

All of the above. Plus:

* The `article` and `section` background colors are as they should be in both files.

* Padding and alignment in both *index.html* and *version2.html* look very close to the version shown in the "Sea Mammals" examples. **Note:** The standards is "looks very close"; you don't need to have the exact same measurements, because you don't know what those are.

* Your header on both pages achieves all criteria listed in Part 1 for the header and nav. The header and its contained elements are arranged like those in video 25 [Use CSS flex to style a header and nav with buttons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iUscQU0yKg) &mdash; and they LOOK LIKE the elements shown in the example video.

* The CSS `margin` and `padding` properties are used correctly and not in excess. That is, you use them where it makes sense, and you do not use them when they are not needed, or redundant.

* `box-sizing` is used correctly.

* All hexadecimal RGB codes are used correctly. No color keywords are used!

* All punctuation marks required in the CSS file are used correctly. Check your semicolons.

* The CSS is formatted neatly, with sensible indents and use of linespaces that make code easy to read.

* All text has **good contrast** against the background color, regardless of which element contains it. This includes the link pseudo classes. You can check contrast here: [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

* You could show your two final pages *and your CSS* to anyone, not just your instructor.

(All criteria must be met to get 15 points.)

## DISHONESTY

Showing your code to any other student, or giving another student code to solve the problem, or any part of the problem, is a violation of the university's honor code. Asking for a solution in any online forum is a violation of the university's honor code. Copying code from another student, past or present, is a violation of the university's honor code. Allowing anyone else to write code for you is a violation of the university's honor code. You must do your own work, or **risk a failing grade for the entire course.** Penalties for academic dishonesty are spelled out in the syllabus for this course.
